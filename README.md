Fun and simple hash algorithm to get a glimpse of what the hardcore cryptographic algorithms like SHA256 and Blake2 are like. No salts are inbedded in the code yet.
The code is written in Python, and only has a 128 and a 64 bit digest as of now. The actual hashing is only used with fairly simple arithmetic and computation. I have comments explaining what I currently have.
Enjoy playing around with it.
